# GGR472 Lab 4: Incorporating GIS analysis into web maps using Turf.js
 
For this lab, I was able to make the hexgrid along with the points where these collisions took place. Throughout I struggled with step 4 and in the end was not able to complete it before the deadline. As well as generating a popup gave me trouble this time. The overall purpose of this map is to generate a hexgrid that stores pedestrian crash data. Displaying the data using colors that make it easy to make out the difference between the hexgrid and the points of where the crashes took place.
